        <h2>You can always count on me</h2>
        <p>In a classroom environment where I feel comfortable I'm usually the one getting told off by the teacher for talking too much (sorry, Bert &#x1F62C). I definitely haven't lost touch with my inner child, which means you can expect me to crack a joke or two every once and a while. Fair warning though, I’ve been told to have a peculiar sense of humour some like to refer to as “dad jokes”. Unfortunately these jokes only work if you git them.

    <div class="centered-paragraph">
        <p><br/><br/>I also like to embark on new projects or challenges with great, somewhat naïve enthusiasm – such as this web development training. Expect me to be highly motivated and sheer you on with a bright smile from ear to ear
            <br/><br/>Besides being maturely immature I'm a perfectionist, which will hopefully be a considerable asset in this course. I have an eagle eye for details, I like to get things just right and organizing everything in an orderly fashion makes me genuinely cheerful. If you don't believe me, come and have a look at my collection of fluorescent pens - which are of course color-coordinated.</p>

    <div class="centered-paragraph"><h2>A funny story</h2>
        <p>In 2017 I decided to pursue a lifelong dream: travel the world. This was truly something I had fantasized about since I was a young child, especially whenever I was heading back home after a vacation abroad, in tears once again.
            <br/><br/>While many peers around me were mirthfully traveling, I too began looking for a willing victim to join me and explore the world. Many eagerly agreed to go on an adventure of a lifetime but in the end nobody really committed, you know how it goes… After all, it <i>is</i> a big step to leave the comfort of your home to go and wander around with nothing more than what you can carry in your backpack.
            <br/><br/>At this point in my life, however, the fear of never having done a major trip and regretting it was greater than the fear of leaving alone. So, here there it was: I was going to travel the world alone. A-L-O-N-E. I quit my job I sincerely loved, I gave up my apartment with a gorgeous garden that was rediciulmously underpriced. I could do this, I had always been an independent, resourceful person. And I was an introverted person anyway, maybe I’d never ever feel lonely and even relish my time being alone.
            <br/><br/>The very first day of my grandiose trip starting in New Zealand, I discovered that the airline I was flying with required proof of me also exiting the country. Since my plan was to have no plan, I didn’t book any tickets in advance. Without it, however, I was not allowed on the plane. I was left with no other choice but to book a random exiting ticket from New Zealand right there and then. No worries, disaster averted.
            <br/><br/>My ordeal was not over yet. There were no available seats at the gate where my plane was due to depart, so I decided to and wait one gate over. In all my excitement, thought, I completely forgot this  and only realized when I happened to take off my headphones and could hear my name over the intercom for the last call to New Zealand. I barely caught my first flight on time – look at me being all independent!

        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p><b> When I left to go travel the world alone, I barely caught my very first flight because I forgot I wasn’t waiting at the correct gate.</b></p></div>
